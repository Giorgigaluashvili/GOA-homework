    <p>The Lexus SC400 might just be the perfect drift car. The only negative thing we can think of is that it may be a bit on the heavy side. This RWD drift beast packs a huge, front-mounted 4.3-liter V8 that produces close to 300 galloping horses, which means it's more than up for some sideways action.</p>
